# Stoplight Game - Nash Equilibrium (Q4)

## Description
A two-player game (human vs computer) implementing the Stoplight Game to demonstrate Nash Equilibrium concepts through random inputs.

## Game Rules
- Two players: Human and Computer
- Each player must decide whether to "Stop" or "Go" at an intersection
- Outcomes are determined by the combination of choices
- Nash Equilibrium demonstrates optimal strategy

## Features
- Interactive game interface
- Random computer moves
- Score tracking
- Nash Equilibrium visualization
- Detailed game outcome explanations

## Implementation Details
- HTML for game structure
- CSS for visual design
- JavaScript for:
  - Game logic
  - Random input generation
  - Nash Equilibrium calculations
  - Outcome determination
  - Score tracking

## Code Documentation
Each line of code is commented to explain:
- Function purpose
- Logic implementation
- Variable usage
- Game mechanics
- Nash Equilibrium concepts

## How to Play
1. Open index.html
2. Choose your action (Stop/Go)
3. Computer makes its move
4. View outcome and Nash Equilibrium explanation
5. Repeat for multiple rounds
